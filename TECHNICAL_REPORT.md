## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background
Makerere University, Uganda's largest and oldest institution of higher learning, hosts thousands of students who require accommodation solutions. The current landscape of hostel discovery relies heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations, physical visits, and fragmented online listings, creating inefficiencies for both students seeking accommodation and hostel managers marketing their properties.

### 1.2 Problem Identification
The primary challenges identified include:
- **Information Fragmentation:** No centralized platform for hostel information
- **Limited Visibility:** Hostel managers lack effective marketing channels
- **Inefficient Search:** Students cannot easily filter and compare accommodations
- **Trust Issues:** Absence of reliable reviews and rating systems
- **Geographic Challenges:** Difficulty assessing proximity to campus facilities

### 1.3 Proposed Solution
The Makerere Hostel Finder addresses these challenges through a mobile-first platform that connects students with hostel managers, providing comprehensive search capabilities, real-time information updates, and trust-building features through reviews and ratings.
